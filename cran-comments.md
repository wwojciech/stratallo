## Resubmission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have updated and extended some existing
algorithms and significantly updated help pages. In particular,
I generalized the rna() function that now supports specification of the
unit costs.

## Test environments

* macOS R 4.3.0
* Rhub:
  - Windows Server 2022, R-release, 32/64 bit
  - Debian Linux, R-release, GCC 

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There was a note shown below.
However, I'd prefer to keep this file, since added to my GitHub repository,
it helps users correctly cite the a GitHub repo with this software.

```
* checking package subdirectories ... NOTE
Found the following CITATION file in a non-standard place:
  CITATION.cff
Most likely ‘inst/CITATION’ should be used instead.
```
