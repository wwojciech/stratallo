## Resubmission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have updated and extended some existing
algorithms and significantly updated help pages. In particular,
I generalized the rna() function that now supports specification of the
unit costs and added helpers functions for rounding.

## Test environments

* macOS R 4.3.0
* Rhub:
  - Windows Server 2022, R-release, 32/64 bit
  - Debian Linux, R-release, GCC 

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs,WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
