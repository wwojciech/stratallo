Description: Functions in this package provide solution to classical problem in
  survey methodology - an optimum sample allocation in stratified sampling
  schemes. In this context, the optimal allocation is in the classical
  Tschuprov-Neyman's sense and it satisfies additional lower or upper bounds
  restrictions imposed on sample sizes in strata. There are few different
  algorithms available to use, and one them is based on popular sample
  allocation method that applies Neyman allocation to recursively reduced set of
  strata.
  This package also provides the function that computes a solution to the minimum
  sample size allocation problem, which is a minor modification of the classical
  optimium sample allocation. This problem lies in the determination of a vector
  of strata sample sizes that minimizes total sample size, under assumed fixed
  level of the pi-estimator's variance. As in the case of the classical optimal
  allocation, the problem of minimum sample size allocation can be complemented
  by imposing upper bounds constraints on sample sizes in strata.
