Description: Functions in this package provide solution to classical problem in
  survey methodology - an optimum sample allocation in stratified sampling
  schemes. In this context, the optimal allocation is in the classical
  Tschuprov-Neyman's sense and it satisfies additional either lower or upper
  bounds restrictions imposed on sample sizes in strata. There are few different
  algorithms available to use, and one them is based on popular sample
  allocation method that applies Neyman allocation to recursively reduced set of
  strata.
  A minor modification of the classical optimium sample allocation problem leads
  to the minimum sample size allocation. This problems lies in the determination
  of a vector of strata sample sizes that minimizes total sample size, under
  assumed fixed level of the pi-estimator's variance. As in the case of the
  classical optimal allocation, the problem of minimum sample size allocation
  can be complemented by imposing upper bounds constraints on sample sizes in
  strata. A function that solves the minimum sample size allocation problem is
  included in stratallo package.
