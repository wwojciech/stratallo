Description: Functions in this package provide solution to classical problem in survey methodology - 
  an optimum sample allocation in stratified sampling scheme with simple random sampling without replacement design in each stratum. 
  In this context, the optimal allocation is in the classical Tschuprow-Neyman's sense,
  and it satisfies additional upper bounds restrictions imposed on sample sizes in strata. 
  There are four different algorithms available to use, and one of them is Neyman optimal allocation applied in a recursive way.
  All the algorithms are described in detail in "Wojciak W. Optimal allocation in stratified sampling schemes.
