# stratallo 2.0.1

* Minor typos corrections in README, vignette, and help pages.

# stratallo 2.0.0

* Added new user function `nopt` for minimization of total sample size under
  constraints on variance and upper bounds on strata sample sizes. 
* Re-factored `rNa` into `rna_one_sided` so that it also computes the allocation
  under optional lower bounds constraints.
* Renamed `nopt` do `dopt` to reflect the fact that it minimizes variance
  function D.
  
# stratallo 0.1.0

* First release.
